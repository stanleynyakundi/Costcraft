            <h3>History of Bricks</h3>
            <p>Bricks date back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians and the Romans. They were initially made from mud and straw, but over time, the process evolved to include fired clay bricks, which are much more durable.</p>
            <h3>Types of Bricks</h3>
            <p>There are several types of bricks, including clay bricks, concrete bricks, and engineering bricks. Each type has its own unique properties and uses in construction.</p>
            <h3>Uses of Bricks</h3>
            <p>Bricks are used in a variety of construction projects, from residential homes to commercial buildings. They are known for their strength, fire resistance, and thermal insulation properties.</p>

<h4>Clay Bricks</h4>
<p>Clay bricks are the most common type of bricks used in construction. They are made from natural clay and fired in a kiln. Clay bricks are known for their durability, strength, and thermal insulation properties. They are commonly used in residential and commercial buildings.</p>

<h4>Concrete Bricks</h4>
<p>Concrete bricks are made from a mixture of cement, sand, and aggregates. They are known for their high compressive strength and are often used in load-bearing walls and foundations. Concrete bricks are also resistant to weathering and can be manufactured in various colors and textures.</p>

<h4>Engineering Bricks</h4>
<p>Engineering bricks are specially designed for applications that require high strength and low water absorption. They are often used in civil engineering projects such as bridges, tunnels, and retaining walls. Engineering bricks are known for their exceptional durability and resistance to harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h4>Fly Ash Bricks</h4>
<p>Fly ash bricks are made from fly ash, a byproduct of coal combustion, mixed with cement and water. They are lightweight, have good thermal insulation properties, and are environmentally friendly. Fly ash bricks are commonly used in non-load-bearing walls and partitions.</p>
